This tool offers you the possibility to download YouTube videos as a sound file and keep them in sync with your local library.
Unlike other YouTube converters you can even download complete playlists and sync them without the need to download all songs again when you added new tracks to your playlist.

#### Want to contribute?
Every contribution is highly appreciated. Feature requests are appreciated too but I can't promise that they will find their way to the final product because this is just a hobby project.


#### About my motivation
I created this tool because tools out there lack the support to sync whole playlists without the need to download every song again.
You can image how annoing it is to download each song seperate from your playlist with a web converter or download your whole playlist again because you added some songs to it,
especially at a size of 100+ songs.

Some free tools out there also have inbuild advertising which I perceive as a nuisance factor.
I wanted to create a free (and open source) tool to offer everybody out there a smart and simple possibility to download their favourite music from YouTube
and of course to make (my own) life a whole lot easier.
